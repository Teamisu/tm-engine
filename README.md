# Teamisu Engine, Release Date: N/A


The intent of this project is to provide a baseline engine for my own games, this is based off of the _Quake 3: Arena_ Engine, it is however not meant to run Q3:A or TA, or any mods, it is meant for games by me.

Credits to [ioquake](https://github.com/ioquake/ioq3) & [quake3e (For Vulkan support mainly)](https://github.com/ec-/Quake3e) for modernizing this great engine of my childhood, without them, this project would've taken much longer to complete.

- [ ] MacOS

- [x] Linux

- [ ] BSD/Unix

- [ ] Homebrew Console Tomfuckery (planned but will be done when the actual damn game is finished)

# Goals

- [ ] **Functional on lower spec hardware** ⚪ (Top Priority)

- [ ] **Cross Platform Engine** ⚪ (Top Priority)

- [ ] **The TM Engine Engine is gonna revolve around Singleplayer rather than MP like Q3:A**

- [ ] **The engine's rendering will be unique from Q3, so it can load higher detailed models and textures**

- [ ] **A usable engine that anyone can use/modify with enough programming experience for said goals (Modding/Standalone Support)**
