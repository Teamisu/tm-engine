# Teamisu Engine, Release Date: N/A


The intent of this project is to provide a baseline engine for my own games, this is based off of the _Quake 3: Arena_ Engine, it is however not meant to run Q3:A or TA, or any mods, it is meant for games by me.

Credits to [ioquake](https://github.com/ioquake/ioq3) & [quake3e (For Vulkan support mainly)](https://github.com/ec-/Quake3e) for modernizing this great engine of my childhood, without them, this project would've taken much longer to complete.


# Platform Support

- [x] Windows

- [ ] MacOS

- [x] Linux

- [ ] BSD/Unix

- [ ] Homebrew Console Tomfuckery (planned but will be done when the actual damn game is finished)

# Goals

- [ ] **Functional on lower spec hardware** ⚪ (Top Priority)

- [ ] **Cross Platform Engine** ⚪ (Top Priority)

- [ ] **The TM Engine Engine is gonna revolve around Singleplayer rather than MP like Q3:A**

- [ ] **The engine's rendering will be unique from Q3, so it can load higher detailed models and textures**

- [ ] **A usable engine that anyone can use/modify with enough programming experience for said goals (Modding/Standalone Support)**

# License

You might notice, that there is a proipretary license attached to this project. This is because the engine will not be open source in the current state it is in. It will be in the GPL2 license when everything is complete and documented. Please don't think this is "closed source garbage," this is more of a move so that nothing comes out and is protected.
